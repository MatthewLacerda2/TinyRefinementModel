# Parameters are stored float32 (NNX's default param_dtype); COMPUTE_DTYPE only
# sets the computation dtype of the matmul-heavy layers. If f16 gradient
# underflow ever becomes a problem, the fix is optax loss scaling, not a
# dtype change.
# FORCE_F32_COMPUTE is a test-only escape hatch: CPU XLA cannot lower the
# f16-with-f32-accumulation matmuls inside the rematerialized scan, so the
# test suite (which defaults to CPU while the GPU trains) sets it. Never set
# it for training.
